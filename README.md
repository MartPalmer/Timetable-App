# Timetable-App

I've written an app that allows a student/teacher to record their school or college timetable timetable on their phone or tablet. This works on the basis that they have a 2 week timetable, 6 periods a day with the final one being an intervention session for extra support. 

The app works, storing data for the timetable, including groups and rooms in a relational SQL database. This is then stored on the phone so that it can be retrieved at a later date. 

The app will also let you navigate through the school year from the dashboard allowing you to search for specific dates. This calculates whether it would be a week A or B (using the terms table within the database) bringing back the relevent lessons for that day. 

I've also implemented a feature allowing the user to record down important dates, such as parents evening, which will be displayed on the dashboard. The dashboard will show only the important dates that will come up over the next 4 weeks. 

I'm currently testing my first prototype on a samsung galaxy s9 phone after ensuring the robustness of the code so far I would like to implement the following improvements.
